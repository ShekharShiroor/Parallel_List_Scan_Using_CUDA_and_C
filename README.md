# Parallel_List_Scan_Using_CUDA_and_C/C++

This program is my class assignment for CSC 196U at Sac State. The program demonstrates Parallel List Scan Using CUDA and C/C++.

The program uses shared memory and constant memory for optimized memory access form the GPU's global memory.

This program does efficient scan kernel using inverse balanced tree traversal. This is an inclusive scan.
